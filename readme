Student Login System

Desciption:
This project is meant to create a tracking system for student logins and out of the M302 classroom at Virginia Western Community College.
This project consist of three PHP files and one CSS file. The PHP files have HTML embebbed to allow for user interaction through a web browser with PHP to handle backend scripting and interaction with a MySQL database.

The Admin.php file will allow an admin to add to and delete class from the MySQL database. Classes must be added before students can login.

The index.php will be the entry point for students. This will allow them to login and will display a confirmation message of upon success and an error if not connected to a database. There is a provide link to the logout.php page.

The logout.php page will allow a student to logout of the system. Included is a link to allow a student to return to the login page.

Deployment:
This project is designed to be deployed using a webserver linked to a MySQL database. We used an apache server with MariaDB hosted on a Raspberry Pi 5/500.

To host the files using the apache add the files to the /var/www/html directory on the Raspberry Pi. This will allow students to access the login using a web browser using the Raspberry Pi's IP address or on the Raspberry Pi using the localhost address if needed.
